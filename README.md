# ML-ASSIGNMENT
This project demonstrates real-time object and sub-object detection using Faster R-CNN with a ResNet-50 backbone. It processes video inputs (from files or webcam) to detect objects and visualize them with bounding boxes and confidence scores. The detections are also exported as structured JSON outputs, providing details like object labels,
